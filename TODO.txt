- Finish material system. Textures?

- Finish sampling: multi-light, shadows, reflections, refractions, ...

- Create system to handle colors: mainly gamma-corrected non-gamma-corrected.
  Also colormaps, which probably implies creating hsl conversion.

- Add more primitives.

- ASCII renderer.

- JPEG/PNG output?

- CLI interface/options.

- Multithreading. Maybe use [1]? Test it.

- Benchmark container.hpp.
  I'm detecting troubling performance diferences between using it and plain
  vectors, but more investigation is needed.

- Add constexpr where applicable.

- Review noexcept usage (particualrly important in move
  constructors/assignments). See [1].

- Post-processing.

- Study using normalized_vector class.

- Simulate camera exposure, even retina exposure maybe (if there is motion)
  instead of just saturating the final color.

- Signed Distance Functions. Raymarching.

- Motion. Video? Output to gif?
